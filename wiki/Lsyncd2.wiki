#summary Manual to lsyncd version 2.x.

= Introduction =
Lsyncd version 2.0 is currently being development as a complete recoding of Lsyncd 1.x. *This manual is as well in development*.

= What is new in 2.0? =
  * Lsyncd 2.x allows you to specify different actions for different kind of events. Particularly moves can now be implemented to be moved locally at the target instead of hitherto deletion of the source and retransfer of the destination.
  * Multiple targets now each have their own waiting list of events. A slow responding targets server does no longer delay others.
  * Lsyncd can be configured to run multiple processes at once for one child. It will resolve any conflicts and only run processes in parallel for files and directories that don't interfere with each other.
  * Lsyncd 2.x does no longer halt and wait for a return of child processes it spawned. The kernels inotify queue will thus continously being drained making _Overflow_s less likely.
  * There is now a "warmstart" option. Instead of the one hugh recursive rsync at startup, lsyncd can now directly start into normal operation. All local directories will be stacked as _Create_ events that will worked off in normal operation mode.
  * The format of the config file has changed compeletly. Instead of XML the configuration file has to be valid [http://www.lua.org/ Lua syntax]. 
  * Consequently lsyncd 2 has no binding to libxml2 anymore, but instead liblua5.1
  * A large part of the lsyncd daemon is now coded in Lua.
